# osx-nbd

This project is an attempt to add NBD block device drivers to OSX.

`osx-nbd` is still in its early stages (if you can call it that; I started this over 10 years ago and didn't get far).
However I'll continue to update this, make sure it builds properly, and is at least in a state where someone
could read and understand the code, and one day it might even start to work.

## Building

This project contains an `.xcodeproj` file, so it should open in XCode and build with cmd-B.

**NOTE** there are currently build errors; will address these.
